For some time now I have had a growing interest in understanding how complex systems behave. This post contains all my current understanding of designing better systems for the future.

<h2>Meaning</h2>

<p>
Life is built around signaling, this text is itself a signal with some meaning I try to convey, reading only half of this text will not allow you to comprehend it's full meaning, just like when encountering many words one doesn't know will result in confusion. So where does meaning lay? In his seminal text Godel Escher Bach, Hofstadter states that meaning itself is a strange dance between content and interpretation. For meaning to be found, content, which by itself meaningless is interpreted. When standing on their own, content and interpretation are interchangeable. GEB illustrates this by imagining a world where DNA is similar to all organisms, and the decoding mechanism in the environment differs. For example a cat and a monkey would contain the same DNA, but the decoding mechanisms which made them grow is what differentiates between them. The genetic information would then not be contained in the DNA but in the decoding mechanisms themselves. The fact that the decoding mechanisms for life are similar while DNA varies is what makes DNA the <i>content</i> and decoding mechanisms the <i>interpretation</i>.

Now what good does it do to know where is meaning without knowing how do we humans give meaning to the world? Think about how words contain meaning even though they exist in our heads.
